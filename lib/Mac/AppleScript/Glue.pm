=head1 NAME

Mac::AppleScript::Glue - allows AppleScript to be written in Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Mac::AppleScript::Glue;

    my $finder = new Mac::AppleScript::Glue::Application('Finder');

    $finder->insertion_location->open;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to write Perl code in object-oriented syntax to
control Mac applications.  The module does not actually execute Apple
Events, but actually translates Perl code to AppleScript code and
causes it to be executed.


=head2 Quick start

The following AppleScript opens the "current" folder in the Finder:

    tell application "Finder"
        open insertion location
    end tell

To do this in Perl, you first include the module:

    use Mac::AppleScript::Glue;

Then you create an object you'll use to talk to the Finder application:

    my $finder = new Mac::AppleScript::Glue::Application('Finder');

And finally you issue the compound statement:

    # open the Finder's "insertion location" in a new window
    $finder->insertion_location->open;

You can save the result of a statement:

    # get the Finder's "insertion location"
    my $loc = $finder->insertion_location;

And if that result is not a scalar, list, or hash (more on this
later), you can use that result as an object to do further work:

    # now open that in a new window
    $loc->open;

You can set attributes:

    my $folder = $finder->make_new_folder;

    $folder->set(name => 'My folder');

If you need to get a particular element of an object, put the
identifier as an argument to the thing that names the element list:

    my $window = $finder->windows(1);

If you need to specify parameters of a command, use a hash for the
parameters, where each key/value pair corresponds to a parameter name
and value:

    my $epson_files = $finder->files(whose_name_contains => 'epson');

You can specify both identifiers and parameters:

    my $epson_files = $finder->files(1, whose_name_contains => 'epson');

Finally, there are cases where you need to create an object reference,
rather than obtaining one from an application.  To do this, you can
use an application object to create a
Mac::AppleScript::Glue::Object(3pm) that refers to both the object
reference and the application to which that reference should belong:

    my $folder = $finder->objref('folder "Applications"');

Then, you can use that as you normally would:

    # open the "Applications" folder
    $folder->open;

If you don't need a full-fledged object, you can simply specify a
parameter of a I<reference> to a scalar containing a string:

    # open the "Applications" folder
    $finder->open(\'folder "Applications"');

This is also what you should use if you need to pass an AppleScript
"constant" along:

    $folder->duplicate(replacing => \'true');

But an easier way is to enclose the name of the constant in
angle-brackets; the module will know to use it verbatim rather than
trying to quote it:

    $folder->duplicate(replacing => '<true>');


=head2 Return values

If you issue a statement that will return a value, like C<insertion
location>, the result of that statement is always a scalar.  The
actual contents of this scalar depends on the sort of statement.  It
will be one of:

=over 4

=item regular scalar

A number or a string.  This is what you'd expect in Perl -- like 1, or
"foo".

=item object reference

An object reference is a textual string that AppleScript uses to
describe both the class and context of a "thing".  For example, the
C<insertion location> statement might return an object reference of:

    folder "Desktop" of folder "johnl" of folder "Users" of startup
    disk of application "Finder"

When Mac::AppleScript::Glue(3pm) sees this sort of reference, it puts the
whole object reference string into an object of type
Mac::AppleScript::Glue::Object(3pm) (see
L<Mac::AppleScript::Glue::Object>).  It also stores in this object the
application object that created the object.  By doing this, the
Mac::Application::Glue::Object(3pm) can be used by itself to access or
modify other data.

=item array or hash reference

If the statement returned an AppleScript "list" or "record", the
result will be a Perl array- or hash-reference, respectively.  This
could contain simple scalars, or a combination of any of the result
types; it can also be nested.

Note that you'll have to dereference the references to use the
elements:

    for my $window (@{ $finder->windows }) {
        ...
    }

or:

    my $props = $finder->properties;

    while (my ($key, $val) = each %{$props}) {
        ...
    }

=back


=head2 Notes

For multi-word AppleScript terms like C<insertion location>, use the
underscore character (_) in place of each space character.

You generally need to reverse the parts of a statement when
translating AppleScript to Perl.  In AppleScript, C<open insertion
location> really sends the "open" message to the object represented by
"insertion location".  This maps to the Perl syntax
C<< insertion_location->open() >>.

Unlike Perl, AppleScript makes a distinction between booleans and
numbers -- you can't intermix them.  So if an AppleScript method wants
a boolean as a parameter, you I<must> use the AppleScript constants
B<true> or B<false>.  You can do this by enclosing the string with
angle-brackets (C<< <true> >>) or passing a reference to a string
containing the constant (C<\'true'>).


=head1 HOW IT WORKS

Contrary to what it might seem, this module knows nothing of Apple
Events, and only knows a sprinkling of AppleScript syntax.

Instead, it actually employs a variety of magic dust to accomplish its
tasks:

=over 4

=item *

The Mac::AppleScript::Glue module translates Perl-style object/method
calls to actual AppleScript.

=item *

The resulting AppleScript is executed by the Mac::AppleScript(3pm)
module (by Dan Sugalski); any results are returned as text.

=item *

The AppleScript-format result data is translated into into Perl data
structures as appropriate.

=item *

Perl's C<$AUTOLOAD> feature (L<perlobj>) is used to translate
statements like C<< $finder->insertion_location >> to AppleScript.
Method calls that aren't defined in the module itself and don't refer
to a part of the object's data structure are delegated to a translater
function that tries to write the method as if it was AppleScript.

=item *

AppleScript's concept of the "object reference" is essential to the 
idea of having Perl objects for things other than applications.

=item *

The AppleScript interpreter seems somewhat lenient on the exact syntax
of the language.  This makes it possible to write AppleScript
statements that work even though they look weird.

=head1 DEBUGGING

Various amounts of debugging can be enabled by manipulating the 
C<%Mac::AppleScript::Glue::Debug> hash.  Debugging usually involves
printing messages to the B<STDERR> file handle.

To turn on a certain type of debugging, specify the key that names the
debug option, and a value of non-zero.  For example, the following
enables debugging of generated AppleScripts:

    $Mac::AppleScript::Glue::Debug{SCRIPT} = 1;

You can get a list of all the debugging keywords by examining
C<@Mac::AppleScript::Glue::DebugAll>.


=head2 Debugging keywords

=over 4

=item SCRIPT

Show each generated AppleScript before it's sent off to the script
interpreter, as well as the AppleScript-formatted result string.  This
is useful when writing programs using Mac::AppleScript::Glue, as
looking at the generated AppleScript is often the best way to figure
out why a statement is failing.

=item RESULT

Show the parsed return value from the AppleScript result.  This is the
data you will be working with when you examine a return value from a
statement.

=item PARSE

Show the process of parsing the AppleScript result.  You probably
don't want to be setting this.

=item INIT

Show the values of Mac::AppleScript::Glue objects after all
initialization has been completed.  You probably don't want to be
setting this.

=item AUTOLOAD

Show attempted calls to non-existent functions and methods.  You
probably don't want to be setting this.

=back


=head1 HINTS

Unfortunately this package doesn't mean that you don't have to know
AppleScript, or the class/event hierarchy of the operating system.
Both of those can be quite inscrutable.

I recommend having the Script Editor program open while writing Perl
code.  Use the dictionary browser (File menu > Open Dictionary) to
browse the dictionaries for the applications you're trying to control.
If you're having trouble getting the right Perl code written, try
writing it in AppleScript first, then translate to Perl, then let this
module translate it back to AppleScript. ;)

If you're trying to navigate through inscrutable AppleScript results,
try using the C<dump_pretty()> function (see above).

Finally, turn on the B<SCRIPT> and B<RESULT> debugging keywords for
the most useful yet not-too-overwhelming debug output.


=head1 BUGS AND ISSUES

=over 4

=item *

It's fairly slow.  This is mostly because a compound statement (C<<
$finder->insertion_location->name >>) requires several separate
AppleScript executions, generally one per element besides the
application object.  It's also slow because under the hood, the Perl
calls are translated to AppleScript, then compiled, and finally
executed.

=item *

Error-handling is nearly non-existant.  If the resulting AppleScript
is bad, or the target applications don't understand the resulting
AppleScript, this module will force a C<die()>, and you will see
